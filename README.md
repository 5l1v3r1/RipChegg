## Features
This is a theoretical JDA Discord Bot that allows you to input a chegg link, and the bot would send a screenshot of the
chegg page. This was my attempt at creating something like this to learn more about Selenium as well as web browsing
and ChromeDriver.

This bot **DOES NOT** work, but feel free to use the code in your own bot.

This project will no longer be getting updates as I am currently finished with this project and have moved on to coding
other programs.

## Limitations
* You are required to have a Chegg account. The bot basically logins to Chegg and navigates to the page and screenshots
it. In order for the page to not be blurred, a premium account is needed.

* However, Chegg knows that people do this and thus has put a Captcha when it thinks that you are a bot. I've tried
doing stuff like login into Google first, simulating human behavior, and storing and uploading login cookies, but none
worked or were uncompleted. There is also the option of using paid Captcha bypassers, but I didn't go down that path.
